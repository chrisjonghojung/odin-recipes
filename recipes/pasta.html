            <p>With a couple pints of tomatoes, garlic, olive oil & Parmesan, you can make this easy burst cherry tomato pasta for a quick weeknight dinner</p>
            <p><strong>Ingriedents</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Spaghetti</li>
                    <li>Garlic</li>
                    <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>Parmesan</li>
                    <li>Olive oil</li>
                    <li>Salt & pepper</li>
                    <li>Fresh herbs</li>
                </ul>
            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I get the pasta out of the way. I cook the spaghetti until it is al dente. Then I drain it and toss the noodles in a splash of olive oil, so they don’t’ stick together.</li>
                    <li>I get started on the tomatoes. I heat olive oil in a large skillet and carefully add the tomatoes. As they cook, I stir them around so they are getting heated on all sides. After a few minutes, the skins on some will start to split.</li>
                    <li>To give the tomatoes a nudge to burst, I softly push them down with the back of a wooden spoon as necessary. You can also use a potato masher to do this.</li>
                    <li>I add the sliced garlic, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to the skillet. I keep cooking and stirring for a few more minutes. By then the tomatoes have released their juices and have turned kind of saucy.</li>
                </ol>
